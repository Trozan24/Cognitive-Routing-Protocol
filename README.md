This repository contains the source code and documentation for the **Cognitive Routing Protocol (CRP)**, a Layer-0/Layer-1 enhancement protocol designed to fundamentally reshape the efficiency, resilience, and profitability of Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN).

---

## The Problem

Today's Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePINs) are powerful in concept but are critically bottlenecked by naive, reactive routing protocols. They typically forward data based on simple, static metrics like geographic proximity or latency, failing to account for the dynamic, real-time state of the network. This leads to systemic inefficiencies, cascading congestion under stress, and vulnerabilities to targeted disruption.

## The Solution: Cognitive Routing

The **Cognitive Routing Protocol (CRP)** addresses these challenges by embedding intelligence directly into the network fabric. It introduces a decentralized network of AI agents, known as **Cognitive Nodes**, that replace static pathfinding with a dynamic, predictive, and incentive-aligned routing policy.

This approach is built on three core pillars:
1.  **Cognitive Nodes**: Each node in the network is equipped with a lightweight AI agent that makes autonomous routing decisions based on a rich set of real-time and historical data, including latency, available bandwidth, cost, and on-chain reputation.
2.  **Reputation & Staking (`TrustScore`)**: An on-chain mechanism requires nodes to stake tokens to participate. A dynamic `TrustScore` evaluates their performance, rewarding reliability and penalizing malicious or inefficient behavior through slashing.
3.  **Game Theory-Centric Incentives**: The protocol's economic model is engineered to reward behavior that benefits the entire network's health, creating a self-optimizing and self-policing system.

## Project Status

This project is currently in: **Phase 1 - Simulation Environment Development.**

The primary goal of this phase is to construct a robust testbed, implement a baseline "dumb" router for comparison, and empirically validate the performance gains of CRP in a controlled environment.

## Tech Stack

* **Simulation & AI Core**: Python
* **Smart Contracts (On-Chain Logic)**: Solidity
* **Blockchain Interaction**: Web3.py

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the simulation on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10 or higher

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Yudis-bit/Cognitive-Routing-Protocol.git](https://github.com/Yudis-bit/Cognitive-Routing-Protocol.git)
    cd Cognitive-Routing-Protocol
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    * On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    * On Windows:
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    *(A `requirements.txt` file will be added in a future phase)*
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Simulation

To run a simulation, execute the corresponding script from the `simulations` directory. Scripts for specific test cases will be developed in upcoming phases.
```bash
python simulations/run_baseline_sim.py
